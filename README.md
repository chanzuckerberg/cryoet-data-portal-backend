### Environment variables

Environment variables are set using the command `export <name>=<value>`.

| Name                | Description                                                                  | Values                      |

| `AWS_PROFILE`       | Specifies the profile used to interact with AWS resources via the awscli.    | `cryoet-dev`, `cryoet-prod` |



### Building the image

The base image is built using Github actions whenever a relevant code change is merged into main. The image build is tagged as `main`.

In the rare event a new build of the image needs to be built without Github Actions, follow the steps below to build the images locally and push it to remote, replacing `<tag-for-build>` with the desired tag for the image.:
```bash
make push-local-ingestor-build tag=<tag-for-build>
```
