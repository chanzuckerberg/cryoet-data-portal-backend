# Community Tomography Data Portal Backend
CryoET Portal API server and ingestion tools forms the backend for the Community Tomography Data Portal. The API server is responsible for serving the data and the ingestion tools are for ingesting the data from the source, transforming them and landing them in the database.

## Developer Guidelines
### Pre-requisite installations and setups

**Note**: Before you begin to install any Python packages, make sure you have activated your Python virtual environment.

1. Install pre-commit: `pre-commit install` or check doc [here](https://pre-commit.com/)
2. Set up your machine to be able to work with AWS using the instructions [here](https://czi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DC/pages/332892073/Getting+started+with+AWS). Please ensure to follow the step 3 `AWS CLI access` instructions all the way to the bottom so that you are also set up for SSH access.
3. [install jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/). If brew is installed run `brew install jq`.

### PR Guidelines
1. PR name should follow the conventional commit format. For example, `feat: add new annotation type` or `fix: fixing error from x`.
2. PR description should be detailed and should follow the template provided.
3. PR should have at least one approved reviewer.
4. PR should pass all the checks before merging.
5. PR should be squashed and merged.


## Modules

This repository contains all components related to the CryoET backend. Below is a brief overview of each module:

### api_server
This module contains the v1 version of the GraphQL API for the CryoET backend. It is implemented using **Hasura**.
**Note**: This version is on the path to deprecation. We should be using the v2 API for building new features.

### apiv2
This module contains the v2 version of the GraphQL API for the CryoET backend. It is implemented using **Platformics**, offering more features over v1.

### docs
This folder contains high-level documentation covering the overall architecture, and related processes.

### ingestion_tools
This module contains all the code related to the process of importing datasets into the backend, transforming the data into standardized format, validating the standardized data. It also contains the yamls that are used for configuring the ingestion process.

### schema
This module is responsible for maintaining the schemas used in both the ingestion configuration and the API. It is implemented using LinkML.

### test_infra
This module has resources required for setting up mock resources for testing, such as files needed for setting up the mock s3 and nginx (mock http servers). This is used by both the ingestion_tools and apiv2 modules.

| `AWS_PROFILE`       | Specifies the profile used to interact with AWS resources via the awscli.    | `cryoet-dev`, `cryoet-prod` |



### Building the image

The base image is built using Github actions whenever a relevant code change is merged into main. The image build is tagged as `main`.

In the rare event a new build of the image needs to be built without Github Actions, follow the steps below to build the images locally and push it to remote, replacing `<tag-for-build>` with the desired tag for the image.:
```bash
make push-local-ingestor-build tag=<tag-for-build>
```
