## Introduction
CZII (Chan Zuckerberg Imaging Institute) electron cryotomography (CryoET) Community Data Portal (‘Data Portal’) aims to assemble curated (formatted/annotated), high-impact CryoET datasets and make them available to computational community to enable comprehensive annotation and object selection in CryoET datasets. This document describes the schema, a type of contract, that requires all datasets to adhere to. By providing this document, we aim to 
1) encourage dataset contributors to provide sufficient metadata to facilitate the interpretation and re-use of submitted datasets;
2) enable searching, filtering, and integration of datasets hosted by the ‘Data Portal’ by using a standardized metadata schema.

## Data elements

### 1. Dataset Metadata
#### 1.1. Dataset
Describes the experiment dataset as a whole. A CryoET dataset typically includes image files for tilt series, tomograms. If available, cellular and/or subcellular annotation files are also included in a dataset.

Dataset is a (nested) dictionary. If a data element has sub-elements, it is a dictionary.

### 2. Sample and experiment conditions
Describe the sample (e.g. sample type, organism, cell type) and experiment condition (including sample preparation and other experimental conditions such as microscopy setup) for all tilt experiments in the dataset

SampleConditions is a (nested) dictionary. If a data element has sub-elements, it is a dictionary.

### 3. Tilt Series Metadata

#### 3.1 Tilt Series
Describes the attributes of the tomographic tilt series. In Cryo-ET, a tilt series is a series of images collected by tilting the sample around a tilt axis and acquiring multiple projection images of the specimen throughout a tilt range. This tilt series is then used to computationally reconstruct a tomogram, a 3D volume of the object being imaged.

TiltSeries is a dictionary. If a data element has sub-elements, it is a dictionary.

## 5. Annotation Metadata

### 5.1 Annotation
Describe the annotations of the CryoET dataset, including annotators, annotation objects, annotation methods etc.

We adopt the following naming convention: tilt_experiment.name+object.name+annotation_instance.name+version.number. There could be multiple annotations by multiple annotators for the same CryoET datasets (tilt series and tomograms), each annotation file is considered an ‘annotation instance’). |

## 6. Annotation File Metadata

### 6.1 Point
Point files are newline-delimited json files ([ndjson](https://clue.engineering/2018/introducing-reactphp-ndjson)). Each
line contains a nested dictionary. 

| Data elements | metadata key 1 | Sub-elements | metadata key 2 | Value type | Unit | Default | Requirement | Controlled vocabularies | Description                                                                      |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|------------|:----:|:-------:|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Location      | location       | x            | x              |  FLOAT     | pix  |   --    | MUST        |                         | x coordinate of the point in pixels, origin is the pixel origin of the 3D image. |
|               |                | y            | y              |  FLOAT     | pix  |   --    | MUST        |                         | x coordinate of the point in pixels, origin is the pixel origin of the 3D image. |
|               |                | z            | z              |  FLOAT     | pix  |   --    | MUST        |                         | x coordinate of the point in pixels, origin is the pixel origin of the 3D image. |

### 6.2 OrientedPoint
OrientedPoint files are newline-delimited json files ([ndjson](https://clue.engineering/2018/introducing-reactphp-ndjson)). Each
line contains a nested dictionary. 

| Data elements | metadata key 1       | Sub-elements | metadata key 2 | Value type            | Unit | Default | Requirement   | Controlled vocabularies | Description                                                                      | 
|---------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------------|:----:|:-------:|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Location      | location             | x            | x              | FLOAT                 | pix  |   --    | MUST          |                         | x coordinate of the point in pixels, origin is the pixel origin of the 3D image. |
|               |                      | y            | y              | FLOAT                 | pix  |   --    | MUST          |                         | x coordinate of the point in pixels, origin is the pixel origin of the 3D image. |
|               |                      | z            | z              | FLOAT                 | pix  |   --    | MUST          |                         | x coordinate of the point in pixels, origin is the pixel origin of the 3D image. |
| Orientation   | xyz_rotation_matrix  | N/A          | N/A            | List\[List\[FLOAT\]\] |  --  |   --    | MUST          |                         | A 3x3 rotation matrix. Example: m=\[\[1, 0, 0\], \[0, 1, 0\], \[0, 0, 1\]\] For numpy array of coordinates such as xyzs=\[\[x1,y1,z1\],\[x2,y2,z,2\]\] in  the frame of subtomogram average (the instance to render):, this transformation brings xyzs from averaged subtomogram to the tomogram.  The center of the rotation is at the center of the averaged subtomogram, i.e. (dimension //2, base0)

### 6.3 SemanticSegmentationMask

Each distinct annotation object name has its own 3D file.  Distinct instances of the same object name are presented as integer labels within the file. For example, if The tomogram volume has one nucleus and three mitochondria segmented, We have 2 files and the mitochondria file would have labeled values 1, 2, 3 for the three instances while unlabeled voxel at a value of 0.
