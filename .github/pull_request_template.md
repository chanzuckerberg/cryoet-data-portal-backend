When creating a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

1. Keep PRs reasonably sized. Max 500 LOC is ideal. Prefer splitting into multiple PRs if you can.
2. Include a description of what your PR does and any background information for nuanced topics.
3. Do not request code reviews until the PR checks pass.

	- And changes require a deployment
		- Add non-closing keywords and link the issues, e.g. "Addresses #issue-number"
		- Provide a checklist of any relevant pre-deployment notes.
	- If changes do not require a deployment (e.g. documentation, CI changes, unit tests)
		- Add closing keywords and link the issues, so it's automatically closed, e.g. "Closes #issue-number"
