# enqueue_runs.py
This script enables us to run dataset ingestions and db ingestions quickly. Its interface is very similar to the `standardize_dirs.py` script, because it's a wrapper around that script, that breaks down a larger ingestion job into per-run chunks, and queues each of those per-run chunks of work into a batch processing system.

## One-time Setup
Make sure you have at least python 3.11 installed. If you need to work with multiple versions of python, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) can help with that.

Before running the script, ensure all the required packages are installed in a virtualenv:
```bash
cd ingestion_tools
python3 -m venv .venv  # create a virtualenv
source .venv/bin/activate  # activate the virtualenv
python3 -m pip install poetry  # Install the poetry package manager
poetry install  # Use poetry to install this package's dependencies
```

## File ingestion (`queue` subcommand)

The `enqueue_runs.py queue` queues up dataset ingestion work to read data from the raw form uploaded by dataset submitters, to the formats expected by the data portal. It launches one task per **run**.

### tl;dr:
```bash
cd ingestion_tools/scripts

# Activate a python virtualenv
source ../.venv/bin/activate

# Set up any required AWS env vars
EXPORT AWS_PROFILE=cryoet-dev

# Main args
# python3 enqueue_runs.py queue [path to dataset config] [source bucket] [destination bucket] [--stuff-to-import]

# Get information on what types of stuff we can import
python3 enqueue_runs.py queue --help

# Example
python3 enqueue_runs.py queue dataset_configs/10000.yaml cryoetportal-rawdatasets-dev cryoetportal-output-test --import-everything
```


### Required arguments

| Argument | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| CONFIG_FILE | This is the path (relative to $CWD) to the dataset ingestion config file, e.g `dataset_configs/10001.yaml` |
| INPUT_BUCKET | Name of the bucket where the deposited data lives (this is usally `cryoetportal-rawdatasets-dev`) |
| OUTPUT_PATH | Output bucket and/or optional prefix for where the transformed data should be written. This is usually `cryoet-data-portal-staging` when ingesting data, but for testing, something like `cryoetportal-output-test/mytestprefix` is common |

### Commonly used options

| Option | Default | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --ecr-tag | main | If you're experimenting with code/config changes, you may have pushed a docker image to the image registry with a different tag, such as `my_name_here`. Use this flag to tell the workers to use the image with this tag to process the dataset. |
| --memory | 24000 | This script creates one job for each `run` found by the script. If some runs have very large tomograms, it may be necessary to increase the amount of memory allocated to each job                                                                |
| --import-everything | | If this flag is passed in, the script will attempt to ingest all data specified in the dataset config, (datasets, runs, annotations, etc etc)                                                                                                     |

### Other interesting options to be aware of
| Option | Default | Explanation |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| --filter-{type}-name | null | If you only want to import a particular run or voxel spacing, you can filter which objects are ingested by specifying this option with a regular expression that matches the object's name. This option can be specified multiple times with multiple regular expressions |
| --exclude-{type}-name | null | If you want to **exclude** a particular run or voxel spacing, you can filter which objects are ingested by specifying this option with a regular expression that matches the object's name. This option can be specified multiple times with multiple regular expressions |

## Database ingestion (`db-import` subcommand)

The `enqueue_runs.py db-import` queues up jobs to read data from S3 and import into the database, making data available via the API. It launches one task per **dataset** and by default it will import **all datasets** unless filters or a list of specific datasets to import are provided.

### tl;dr:
```bash
cd ingestion_tools/scripts

# Activate a python virtualenv
source ../.venv/bin/activate

# Set up any required AWS env vars
EXPORT AWS_PROFILE=cryoet-dev

# Main args
# python3 enqueue_runs.py db-import [--stuff-to-import]

# Get information on what types of stuff we can import
python3 enqueue_runs.py db-import --help

# Staging Example, importing two depositions and two datasets
python3 enqueue_runs.py db-import --import-everything --include-dataset 10001 --include-dataset 10002 --import-depositions --deposition-id 10001 --deposition-id 10002

# Prod example
export AWS_PROFILE=cryoet-prod
python3 enqueue_runs.py db-import --environment prod --import-annotation-authors --filter-datasets '.000[12]'

```

### Commonly used options
| Option | Default | Explanation |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| --environment | staging | Whether to import data into the `staging` (default) or `prod` database/api |
| --s3-bucket | `cryoet-data-portal-staging` in staging, or `cryoet-data-portal-public` in prod | Which S3 bucket to read files and metadata from |
| --https-prefix | `https://files.cryoet.staging.si.czi.technology` in staging or `https://files.cryoetdataportal.cziscience.com` in prod | This is the https protocol and domain that will be prefixed to all file paths. It's used to generate the https url's for files referenced by the api |
| --ecr-tag | main | If you're experimenting with code/config changes, you may have pushed a docker image to the image registry with a different tag, such as `my_name_here`. Use this flag to tell the workers to use the image with this tag to process the dataset. |
| --import-everything | | If this flag is passed in, the script will attempt to ingest all data specified in the dataset config, (datasets, runs, annotations, etc etc) |

| --deposition-id   | null | To be used with the --import-depositions flag to specify the depositions to be imported                                                                                                            |


## S3 File Sync (`sync` subcommand)

The `enqueue_runs.py sync` command queues up jobs to sync data from the staging s3 bucket to the production s3 bucket. It launches one task per **dataset** and by default it will sync **all datasets** unless filters or a list of specific datasets to sync are provided.

### tl;dr:
```bash
cd ingestion_tools/scripts

# Activate a python virtualenv
source ../.venv/bin/activate

# Set up any required AWS env vars
EXPORT AWS_PROFILE=cryoet-dev

# Main args
# python3 enqueue_runs.py sync [--include|--exclude]

# Get information on what types of stuff we can import
python3 enqueue_runs.py sync --help

# Example
python3 enqueue_runs.py sync --exclude '*' --include 'Annotations/*.json' --s3-prefix 10002 --dryrun

```

### Commonly used options
| Option | Default | Explanation |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| --include | `*` | Which filenames should be sync'd. The order of `--include/--exclude` flags matters, please [see the AWS docs on this topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/#use-of-exclude-and-include-filters) for more information. |
| --exclude | | Which filenames should not be sync'd. The order of `--include/--exclude` flags matters, please [see the AWS docs on this topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/#use-of-exclude-and-include-filters) for more information. |
