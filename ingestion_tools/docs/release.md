# Releasing updates to Ingestion

There is no fixed release cycle for updates. Changes merged into the main branch are automatically picked up and incorporated into the subsequent ingestion process.

**Important:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test and validate your changes for regressions before merging them to the main branch. Inaccurate changes can impact the ingestion process.


## How Does the Process Work?

The ingestion process is automated using GitHub Actions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what happens:

1. When changes are merged into main, the [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cryoet-data-portal-backend/blob/709e8a006b542abe824edc394281059dda29a757/.github/workflows/push-ingestor-build.yaml) is triggered.
2. The workflow builds a Docker image and pushes it to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) with the `main` tag.


## Testing Changes in AWS Before Merging

To test changes in AWS before they are merged into the main branch, follow these steps:

### 1. Build and Push the Image Locally

You can build the image locally and push it to the remote ECR with a custom tag. Replace `<tag-for-build>` with your desired image tag.

```bash
make push-local-ingestor-build tag=<tag-for-build>
```

This will make the image available in AWS with the specified tag, which can be referenced by your test jobs.


### 2. Push an Already Built Image to AWS

If you've already built the image locally, you can simply push it to AWS by running the following command. Replace `<tag-for-build>`` with your tag, and `<aws-region>`` with the desired AWS region.

```bash
make push-ingestor-build tag=<tag-for-build> region=<aws-region>
```
Once this is done, your image will be available in AWS and ready for use in testing.

------------------

By following these steps, you can ensure that your changes are properly tested in a staging-like environment before they are merged into the main branch.

## How to use the tags in execution?

The tag of the images can be used when queuing up a job in AWS with the  `--ecr-tag` option. For example, to use an image tagged `db-new-feature` instead of the `main` for a db-import execution:

```
python3 enqueue_runs.py db-import --import-dataset --include-dataset 10000 --ecr-tag db-new-feature
```

If no specific `--ecr-tags` are provided when queuing up the jobs, it defaults to using the `main` tag. For more on this, refer to [the enqueue documentation](./enqueue_runs.md).
